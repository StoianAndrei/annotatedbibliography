**Welcome!**

This is a book is an artifact that I deliver as part of my directed study on
Veracity. It will describe all the sources that were used to inspire the final
solution.

An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and
documents. Each citation is followed by a brief (usually about 150 words)
descriptive and evaluative paragraph, the annotation. The purpose of the
annotation is to inform the reader of the relevance, accuracy, and quality of
the sources cited.

This template provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create
your book.

The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you get
started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start fresh.
