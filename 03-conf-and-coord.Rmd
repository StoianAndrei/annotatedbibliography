# Conflict and Coordination


Wikipedia, a wiki-based encyclopedia, has become one of
the most successful experiments in collaborative knowledge
building on the Internet. As Wikipedia continues to grow,
the potential for conflict and the need for coordination
increase as well. This article examines the growth of such
non-direct work and describes the development of tools to
characterize conflict and coordination costs in Wikipedia.
The results may inform the design of new collaborative
knowledge systems.
