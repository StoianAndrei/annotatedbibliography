# Augmented Social Cognition: Using Social Web technology to enhance the ability of groups to remember, think, and reason

-   Palo Alto Research Center 3333 Coyote Hill Road, CA 94304, USA

    1.  Ed H. Chi

We are experiencing a new Social Web, where people share, communicate, commiserate, and conflict with each other. As evidenced by systems like Wikipedia, twitter, and delicious.com, these environments are turning people into social information foragers and sharers. Groups interact to resolve conflicts and jointly make sense of topic areas from "Obama vs. Clinton" to "Islam."

PARC's Augmented Social Cognition researchers -- who come from cognitive psychology, computer science, HCI, CSCW, and other disciplines -- focus on understanding how to "enhance a group of people's ability to remember, think, and reason". Through Social Web systems like social bookmarking sites, blogs, Wikis, and more, we can finally study, in detail, these types of enhancements on a very large scale.

Here we summarize recent work and early findings such as: (1) how conflict and coordination have played out in Wikipedia, and how social transparency might affect reader trust; (2) how decreasing interaction costs might change participation in social tagging systems; and (3) how computation can help organize user-generated content and metadata.

## Comment on the intended audience

The audience for the article are both academic and business audience alike. It favors professionals that work with technologies that *augment human intelligence*.

## Compare or contrast this work with another you have cited

This article is looking at how augmented social cognition can develop engineering models for systems that enhance a group's ability to remember, think, and reason.

The author applied thorough scientific rigor in constructing the hypothesis and then test it. It defined metrics and made sure that data set bias is minimized.

## Explain how this work illuminates your bibliography topic

While more enterprises contemplate the benefits of Web 2.0 social software. In this article the author explore a solution that utilize force directed layout structure employed in a revert graph. This technique allows them to translate reverts to users and group them together in users that have similar interests. From there the author describes a dashboard that highlights each revision done on a list of articles.
